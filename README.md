```lrc
[00:03.36] I only wanted to have fun
[00:08.42] Learning to fly, learning to run
[00:12.69] I let my heart decide the way
[00:17.20] When I was young
[00:21.45] Deep down, I must have always known
[00:26.26] That this would be inevitable
[00:30.81] To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
[00:35.34] And bare my soul
[00:53.11] I know I'm not the only one
[00:58.50] Who regrets the things they've done
[01:02.47] Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[01:06.71] Who can't stand the reflection that they see
[01:11.52] I wish I could live a little more
[01:16.07] Look up to the sky, not just the floor
[01:20.59] I feel like my life is flashing by
[01:25.13] And all I can do is watch and cry
[01:29.64] I miss the air, I miss my friends
[01:34.21] I miss my mother, I miss it when
[01:38.99] Life was a party to be thrown
[01:43.22] But that was a million years ago
[01:51.75] When I walk around all of the streets
[01:57.14] Where I grew up and found my feet
[02:01.65] They can't look me in the eye
[02:05.30] It's like they're scared of me
[02:10.12] I try to think of things to say
[02:15.44] Like a joke or a memory
[02:19.50] But they don't recognize me now
[02:23.73] In the light of day
[02:41.79] I know I'm not the only one
[02:47.15] Who regrets the things they've done
[02:51.14] Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[02:55.37] Who never became who they thought they'd be
[03:00.17] I wish I could live a little more
[03:04.74] Look up to the sky, not just the floor
[03:09.26] I feel like my life is flashing by
[03:13.83] And all I can do is watch and cry
[03:18.31] I miss the air, I miss my friends
[03:22.84] I miss my mother, I miss it when
[03:27.65] Life was a party to be thrown
[03:31.97] But that was a million years ago
[03:37.47] A million years ago
